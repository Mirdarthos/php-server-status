# PHP Raspberry PI status monitor

I found the original page looking for something to keep an eye on my Raspberry Pi (that I use as a small server.) preferrably using PHP. Found the project, decided it's what I want, downloaded it, and used it for less than a day before I started modifying it. With this as result, a constant work in progress, and things might (read: will probably) change without
notice. So do not use it unless you want to get your hands dirty.
