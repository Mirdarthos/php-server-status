I found the original page looking for something to keep an eye on my Raspberry Pi (that I use as a small server.)
preferrably using PHP. Found the project, decided it's what I want, downloaded it, and used it for less than a day before
I started modifying it. With the result, this is a work in progress, and thing might (read: will probably) change without
notice. So do not use it unless you want to get your hands dirty.
